# Clarkson University:  Multi-modal Longitudinal Children Biometric Dataset

Available to CITeR members only under the CITeR Database Release Agreement. 

Please contact citer@clarkson.edu and indicate the specific dataset.

Technical Contact: Stephanie Schuckers, sschucke@clarkson.edu 

Data collected from six different modalities collected at an approximate time interval of six months, longitudinally over 9.5 years. Collected at Potsdam Elementary School and Potsdam High School. Funded by the CITeR and National Science Foundation. This biometric dataset collection contains data of six biometric modalities. Few modalities are collected using more than one sensor:

* Fingerprints
* Footprints
* Face
* Ear
* NIR iris
* Voice recordings


Collection Summary:

**Time Span:** 9.5 years

**Sessions:** 19 sessions (4 sessions missed due to covid-19)

**Participation Count:** 360

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Not all subjects participated in all collections. The variation in the number of participants for each collection is impacted by newly enrolled participants each school year, absentees, those unwilling toparticipate on a given day, and participants whose family has moved out of the school district.*

**Age Span of participants:** 4 years to 11 years at enrollment
